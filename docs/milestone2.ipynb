    "# 1 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The increasing importance of computational models in science and business alongside the slowing pace of advances in computing hardware has increased the need for efficient and accurate evaluations of derivatives. Many important applications such as simulation, opti- mization, and neural networks rely on repeated differentiation of complex functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the advent of automatic differentiation (AD) the primary method for derivative evaluation was the method of finite differences (FD), where the function to be evaluated is effectively treated as black box oracle.1 As the FD method is effectively sampling, the granularity (i.e. step size) of the algorithm can introduce error effects if it is either too large or too small, but even at the perfect medium, f′(x) evaluations cannot reach machine precision. The alternative approach, fully symbolic differentiation (SD), is cumbersome and inefficient in many cases. In the case of a complex computer program, the size of the symbolic expression could grow to outrageous size and cause significant inefficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach of algorithmic differentiation seeks to find the best of both worlds, with machine precision and easy evaluation. This is done by repeated evaluation of the chain rule at a point stored in a table called the computational trace. Thus rather than storing to full symbolic expression, an AD code only needs to apply the chain rule to a specific evalua- tion, representable by a single variable. This approach allows us to achieve the accuracy of symbolic approaches while drastically reducing the cost of evaluation.\n",
    "Within the umbrella of automatic differentiation, we seek to implement the forward mode which evaluates the intermediate results directly in an inside out manner. Other approaches such as reverse mode also have specific advantages especially in the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence– or in any context in which the number of inputs dominates the number of outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method of automatic differentiation, sometimes also referred to as algorithmic differ- entiation, addresses the weaknesses of the finite difference method by providing a systematic way to calculate derivatives numerically to arbitrary precision. The goal of AutoDiff is to implement the forward mode of automatic differentiation, as it is a relevant feature that even some mainstream machine learning libraries, such as PyTorch, lack.\n",

    "## 3.1 Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming that the user already has the latest version of Python and a package manager of choice installed, the first step towards using AutoDiff will be the installation. This can be accomplished using conda or pip, the two most popular package managers. This process will vary slightly, depending on the operating system, but essentially, the user will execute commands from the terminal to update the package manager and install AutoDiff.\n",

    "# Using conda\n",
    "conda update conda\n",

    "pip install AutoDiff\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.2 Getting Started\n",
    "Once AutoDiff is installed, the user must import it to be able to use it. The user will have the option to either import the entire library or to choose only a subset of modules, classes, or methods to import. For instance, if the user only wishes to import the automatic differentiation class (and all of its methods) for linear functions of the form f(x) = αx + β, then they will have the freedom to do so. It is widely accepted as good practice to use an alias when importing libraries. In the following example, the alias for AutoDiff.linear is just linear. Users will have the ability to define their own alias.\n",
